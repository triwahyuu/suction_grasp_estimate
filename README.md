# Suction Grasp Estimate
This is repository contains part of my bachelor thesis code, which is a suction-based grasp point estimation that is implemented with PyTorch. 

This project is highly inspired by the work of MIT-Princeton's Amazon Robot Challenge (ARC) 2017 team for robot vision suction-based grasp estimation.
