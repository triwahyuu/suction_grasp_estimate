# Suction Grasp Estimate
This is repository contains part of my bachelor thesis code, which is a suction-based grasp point estimation that is implemented with PyTorch.  
Trained model weight: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p8tBPBJ8JOdhIi5Ra7pKKaZeebAH2iE8?usp=sharing).

This project is highly inspired by the work of MIT-Princeton's Amazon Robot Challenge (ARC) 2017 team for robot vision suction-based grasp estimation.
